PairCraft is a playful SvelteKit app for creating fair pairings. Enter participants, set “can’t match” rules with a slick multi-select UI, and generate shareable assignments for Secret Santa, buddy systems, and more. Pairs and exceptions persist locally, keeping the workflow smooth across sessions.
